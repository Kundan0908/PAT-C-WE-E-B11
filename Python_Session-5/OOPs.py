# Types of programming language -: High level
# Procedural, Functional, Object-oriented, scripting and logic programming
    # Procedural: Focus on executing a sequence of instruction. ex-C
    # Functional: computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
    # OOPs: It organizes code around the concept of objects which contain data(attributes) and actions(method). Python, C++
    # Scripting: Often used for automating tasks, creating scripts and embedding code with other applications. Javascript, Python
    # Logic Programming: It uses logic statements and rules to express computations, allowing the system to derive answers based on those statements. Prolog

# Python OOPs
# empowers to build scalable, maintainable and modular applications. By understanding the core OOPs principles.
# By utilising OOPs capabilities to design elegant and efficient solns to complex problems
#  Uses classes and objects to represent real world entities and their behaviour
#  In OOPs objects has attributes that has specific data and can perform certain actions using methods.

# OOPs concepts -> Class, Objects,Polymorphism, encapsulation, Inheritance, Data abstraction
